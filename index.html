 <h1><b><a id="learn_to_do">What you'll Learn to Do:</a></b></h1>

- Build a web page and put it online<br>
- Automate email<br>
- Piece together a program

<h1><b>Thinking like a Programmer</b></h1>

- Procedural Thinking: Step by step<br>
- Abstract Thinking: Finding similarity (1 + 1 = 2)<br>
- Systems Thinking: Big picture thinking, creating a plan<br>
- Technological Empathy: Understanding a computer (what is, does good/bad, how it works)<br>
- Debugging: Systematic process is identifying issue (bug) in code.

                                                              </div>

<div id="nitty-gritty"><p><b>The Basics of the Web (Unit 1, March 11th, 2015)</b></p>

<h2><img src="http://puu.sh/gvRCz/a7cbbcc1b3.jpg" alt="Image of Internet"></h2>

A) Browser - A program that displays files found on the web (Program)<br>
B) Internet - Largest network in the WORLD!!<br>
C) HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol<br>
D) Servers - Computers dedicated to hosting the files browsed by your browser

<p><b>HTML</b></p>

Hypertext Markup Language. These form the majority of documents on the web.<br>
These documents contain markups (tags, etc), references (images), text content, and hyperlinks.

<p><b>Tags/Elements</b></p>

Tags include things such as &lt;&gt;, &lt;m&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;r&gt; and many more.<br>
(Period used to keep them from activating, is there a way to do this differently?)<br>
Tags can also be within each other.

<p>Elements are the entire structure, such as using the opening and closing tag sandwiching the contents.</p>

<p><b>HTML Attributes</b></p>

An attribute example learned in this lesson was &lt;ref&gt;, with the tag &lt;&gt; to allow for hyperlinking!<br>
<p>Example of hyperlinking: <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity!</a></p>
Example of embedding an image: <p><img src="http://whatscookingamerica.net/Vegetables/Russet_Potato.jpg" alt="A potato"></p>

<p>The above is an example of a void tag. It does not need a tag with / in it to complete it.</p>

<p><b>Whitespace</b></p>

<p>This is the use of a tag that is used to break up a line<br> to the next one on a webpage, since you can
break a line within HTML and without the tag, it won't show as a broken line.</p>

The &lt;p&gt; tag can be used the same way as the &lt;r&gt; tag can be used, except that it breaks twice, so it can be used<br>
to double space essentially.

<p><b>Inline/Block</b></p>

I am fuzzy on this concept. From my understanding tags such as &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;, or &lt;pan&gt; (which I don't understand)<br>
are all inline, meaning they don't form a block and stay in line such as:<br>

<span>This is span, see how it doesn't break up?</span><br>
<br>
   <div>But this one did </div>break up?<br>
<br>
This requires more practice, I'm not comfortable with it yet.
                                                          </div>

I consider myself an expert in... Well, photography. Maybe video games and I'm pretty good at planning too.

<br>
Ignorance -> Awareness can take minutes<br>
Awareness -> Ability can take days<br>
Ability -> Fluency can take... well years!</p>

<p><b>Don't allow confusion to turn into disappointment or anger!</b><br>
Confused?<br>
- Ask for help<br>
- Discuss<br>
- Take a break!<br>
- Just keep going, continue to the answer and try to understand it!</p>

<p><b>Webpages, Documents, and Structures</b></p>

<p><b>HTML</b> is a webpage, through and through. Simple webpage.<br>
   <b>Webpage</b> is inheritly visual. HTML, CSS, Java all work together.</p>
   <p><b>Website as a House:</b><br>
   - HTML is the structure: walls, bedrooms<br>
   - CSS is the decor: color carpeting, color walls, etc<br>
   - Javascript is interactive things: garage door, remote control, microwave</p>

   <p><b>Developer Tools Uses the DOM</b></p>
   DOM stands for Document Object Model<br>
   - It is a programming interface for HTML, XML, and SVG documents. Provides a structured representaiton of the document<br>
   like in the image below.<br>
   <br>

   <img src="http://i.imgur.com/jm4ugr9.jpg" alt="image of the DOM">

<p><b>BOXES!!!!!!!!!</b></p>

Everything is a box, got it? You're a box, I'm a box, we're all boxes when it comes to HTML.<br>
When you see circles on a page? It's a box.<br>
When you see a million things on a page? It can most likely be condensed into 10 or 15 boxes that you can mess around with by...<br>
- Pressing F12 while on a page and looking at developer tools! Or<br> right clicking an element and saying "inspect".

<div id="march-17th">
  <a id="march_17">
  <h1><b>March 17th, 2015</b></h1></a>

  <b>&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;<br></b>
  <p>This is used to tell the browser the code is in HTML</p>
  <p><b>&lt;TML&gt;</b></p>
  Top level tag, comes after DOCTYPE! to inform that it is also an HTML file
  <p><b>&lt;ink&gt;</b></p>
  This is the tag used for linking the HTML file to the CSS file. It looks like below:<br>
  &lt;ink rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="insert_file_name_here"&gt;
  <p>&lt;<b>body</b>&gt;</p>
  This is where the body of the text lives, obviously!
  <p>&lt;<b>style</b>&gt;</p>
  This is a little fuzzy for me, I'm not sure of the exact use of it unfortunately.

  <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b></p>
  Used for describing the look and formatting of the HTML. Works a lot like:<br>
   <p>National Law &lt;State Law &lt;Municipal Law &lt;House Rules</p>
   Though, it is important to remember that with CSS, House rules would also apply to national law.<br> Take out the garbage on Sundays? Enforceable by the government in CSS!!
 </div>

<div id="march_18th">
  <a id="march_18">
  <h1>March 18th, 2015 Boxes!!</h1></a>

  <p><img src="http://puu.sh/gH5ZM/de0fe3c634.png" alt="image of box with content padding border and margin"></p>

  <p><b>Content</b> Usually the image or the text, in the very middle of the "box".<br>
  <b>Padding</b> Clears area around content, padding is transparent.<br>
  <b>Border</b> A border that goes around the padding and content.<br>
  <b>Margin</b> Clears an area outside the border, The margin is transparent.</p>

  <p><b>Boxing Sizing</b><p>
    - HTML elements are boxes: four elements inside it (content, padding, border, margin)
    - Sizing a box correctly can be difficult. <p>Two techniques you can use are as follows:</p>

          -Set pixels in percents (%) rather than pixels (px)<br>
          -Set box-sizing as border-box for every element: &lbrace; box-sizing: border-box; &rbrace; (obvious CSS formatting would be applied)

  <p><b>Box Positioning</b></p>

  Divs are block elements (NOT INLINE)<br>
  - By default this makes them take up the entire width of a page<br>
  - So, add the rule "display:flex;" to appropriate CSS. This will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.

<p><b>Test > Modify > Refine > Test > Modify > Refine > etc.</b></p>
- Look for natural boxes<br>
- Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.<br>
- Write your HTML.<br>
- Apply styles!!! ! !!! ! ! Make it pretty.<br>
- Fix things.<br>
- Did you fix things? Fix thing.<br>
